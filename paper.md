# Summary

**VLRK-Lite** is a lightweight, public QA framework designed to simulate real-time issue monitoring, scoring, and fraud detection. It is derived from enterprise QA strategies deployed in regulated environments such as sports betting and media streaming.

# Statement of Need

Critical systems require more than binary test results - they need dynamic frameworks that can detect patterns and respond to emergent risks. VLRK-Lite introduces score-based anomaly detection to CI/CD and QA pipelines, enabling pre-alerts before production regression.

# Implementation

VLRK-Lite is structured with modular components for monitoring, scoring, and alerting. It is config-driven and extensible for QA teams of all sizes.

# Acknowledgments

This version reflects lessons learned while contributing to secure system readiness.
